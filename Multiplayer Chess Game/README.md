# 620-P2-Starter
- Follow the instructions given in Canvas (Projects > Project 2: Implementation) to create a new Django project at the root of this repository.
- Be sure to also read though the requirements listed in Project 2: Report and Project 2: Demo Video before starting to implement Project 2.
- It is highly recommended to use GitHub Codespaces as your develeopment environment for the implementation of Project 2, but if you decide to use an alternate development environment, be sure to use Python version 3.12.x & Django version 4.2.x.
- To access Codespaces, within this github repository, under the green Code button, select the CodeSpaces tab, and then select "Create codespaces on main".  It will take a few minutes for the VM to spin up the first time. 
- Commit and push your work-in-progress regularly to avoid losing work.
